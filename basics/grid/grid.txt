Grid : grid is a modern responsive css layout which is used to display items / elements in two dimensional way (row & column) in web page. 
  parent properties:
      display : grid --- it is used to make the container grid and it fits all its child items as a single columns .
      grid-template-columns : its is used to specify individual columns width 
        grid-template-columns -- 100px 50px 200px; creates 3 columns of respective widths.
        grid-template-columns -- 20% 50% 30%; creates 3 columns of respective percentages.
        grid-template-columns -- 1fr 2fr 3fr; divides into 3 columns of respective fractions.
        we can also specify repeat(n,x) where n is no of time to repeat x value.

     grid-template-rows --- it is used to specify each rows height similarly grid-template-columns
     gap --- it is used to provide gap between the items . we can also specify row-gap and column-gap
     justify-content --- it is used to move items along row 
     align-content --- it is used to move items along column 

   Child properties :
       we need to divide and understand grid as grid tracks (grid row line and column lines)
       grid-column-start : starting column line number
       grid-column-end : ending column line number
       grid-column : grid-column-start/grid-column-end;
       grid-row-start: starting row line number
       grid-row-end : ending row line number
       grid-row : grid-row-start/grid-row-end;
       grid-area : grid-row-start/grid-column-start/grid-row-end/grid-column-end;
       order : by default every element order is 0 and elements arranged according to the increasing order

  Media queries : Media queries are used for responsiveness of the website. we can make the styles (css) works for specific widths. 
    eg:
      large devices --- >=1400px
      laptops     ----->=1280px to 1400px
      desktop     ----->=1080px to 1280px
      tablets     ----->=768px to <1080px
      mobiles(landscape) -->= 576px to <768px
      mobiles(portrait) --- 0 to <576px

   Best Approach for web design is mobile first design (MFD)

      @media (min-width:1280px) and (max-width:1480px){
        /* laptops */
      }         

  Animations :
    Animations are used to make a element goes through multiple states . Every Animation contains folowing properties such as 
      Animation-name : name of the Animation
      Animation-duration : time of the Animation(in seconds)
      Animation-timing-function : controls the speed of Animation(ease/ease-in/ease-out/ease-in-out/linear)
      Animation-iteration-count  : number of times Animation repeats (number or infinite)
      Animation-direction : decides which direction Animation should run (normal/reverse/alternate/alternate-reverse)
      Animation-delay : time to delay the Animation (in seconds)

     We can use websites like "lottifiles" or "animista" for Animations.

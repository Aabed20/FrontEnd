CSS Introuction:
CSS stands for Cascading styles sheets. Cascading refers to the styles that are applied to elements in a web page. CSS is used to style/design the layout or appearance of web pages.
 CSS can be used in 3 ways in html:
    i.Inline styling 
    ii.Internal styling
    iii.External styling
 i.Inline styling :
  It is used to apply styles to a specific element using 'style' as attribute.
   <element style="property:value;....">conetent</element>
  ii.Internal styling: It is used to apply styling to a specific element or a multiple elements using selectors and style as an 'element'
   <style>
    selector 
    {
        property:value;....
    }
   </style>  
Inline is powerful than the internal and External.

iii.External style:
 It is used to apply styles to single/multiple elements in a separate file with .css extension and attach it to the HTML using 'Link' tag
  <Link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />
CSS styles of internal and External can override each oother based on which comes last 
!important is the highest preference for properties
h1{
    color:red !important;
}
!important > inline> internal/external

Basic selectors:
    To apply styles to multiple elements, we need to select the elements. For that, we use selectors. Most common selectors are:
     i. Tag name selector: It is used to select all elements of specific tag name.
     tagname{
        properties:values;
     }
     ii. Class Name: 'Class' is an attribute to elements which is used to select multiple elements. one element may contain multiple Class names and multiple elements may contain the same Class name
     .classname{
        properties:value;
     }

     iii.id : id is used to identify an element uniquely. No two elements have same id and no elements will contain more than one id
     #idName{
        properties:values;
     }

     id>classs>tagname
     
     iv. Universal selector: if you want to apply styles to all elements in a webpage, you can Universal selector(*)

     *{
        text-align:center;
     }

CSS Introuction:
CSS stands for Cascading styles sheets. Cascading refers to the styles that are applied to elements in a web page. CSS is used to style/design the layout or appearance of web pages.
 CSS can be used in 3 ways in html:
    i.Inline styling 
    ii.Internal styling
    iii.External styling
 i.Inline styling :
  It is used to apply styles to a specific element using 'style' as attribute.
   <element style="property:value;....">conetent</element>
  ii.Internal styling: It is used to apply styling to a specific element or a multiple elements using selectors and style as an 'element'
   <style>
    selector 
    {
        property:value;....
    }
   </style>  
Inline is powerful than the internal and External.

iii.External style:
 It is used to apply styles to single/multiple elements in a separate file with .css extension and attach it to the HTML using 'Link' tag
  <Link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />
CSS styles of internal and External can override each oother based on which comes last 
!important is the highest preference for properties
h1{
    color:red !important;
}
!important > inline> internal/external

Basic selectors:
    To apply styles to multiple elements, we need to select the elements. For that, we use selectors. Most common selectors are:
     i. Tag name selector: It is used to select all elements of specific tag name.
     tagname{
        properties:values;
     }
     ii. Class Name: 'Class' is an attribute to elements which is used to select multiple elements. one element may contain multiple Class names and multiple elements may contain the same Class name
     .classname{
        properties:value;
     }

     iii.id : id is used to identify an element uniquely. No two elements have same id and no elements will contain more than one id
     #idName{
        properties:values;
     }

     id>classs>tagname
     
     iv. Universal selector: if you want to apply styles to all elements in a webpage, you can Universal selector(*)

     *{
        text-align:center;
     }

  Colors: colors decide the brand and user interface of that page. it is recommended to use colors according to the brand and target audience.
  (coolors for selecting good colors.)/(realtimecolors website to check how colors looking)

  Colors can be mentioned in CSS in various ways. They are:
     i. hexCode -- Every color will have an Hexa Decimal code of 6 digits followed by #
     ii.RGB(red,green,blue) -- any color can be represented as a combination of colors red, green, and blue from 0 to 255 values.
     we can even assign alpha 0.0 to 1.0 showing transparancy from lightness to darkness
     iii. name: VSCode provides multiple colors with name 

Fonts : Every font family in world belongs to any one of these 5 types.
  serif: These fonts have strokes at corners, eg:Times New Roman
  sans-serif: These fonts not have strokes at corners, eg: Arial, calibri
  Mono-space: These fonts have equal height of letters like a typewriter
  Cursive: These  fonts are style and curved
  Fantasy: These fonts are used for special effects.

 How to get fonts in webpages
   font-family : it is used to apply fonts to specific element   

   font-size: it is used to change the size of the font

   font-weight: it is used to change the thickness of font (100-900/bold/bolder)

   font-style: it is used to change the style of the font (normal/italic)  

   (note: go to google fonts to select more fonts, after selecting font click get font & click on get embedded code and click on @import & copy the code).

 Units : Units are used to measure the size of elements. Most used units are
   px(pixels) --it is the smallest units of screen.
   %(percentage) -- it is used X% of parent's size 
   vh/vw -- it is the x$ of viewport height or viewport width (viewport = screen)

 Background : we can assign a Background color or Background-image to the webpage using folloing properties:
   Background-color : it is used to assign the color for Background.
   Background-image : it is used to assign Background images using url or gradients
   Background-repeat : it will repeat ?repeat-x/repeat-y?no-repeat
   Background-position : left/right/center/top/bottom
   Background-size : decides the size of Background auto/cover/contain
   Background-attachment : auto/scroll/fixed

Linear gradients : gradients are the transformation of one color to another. Linear gradient assigns colors in straight way.
       background-image: Linear-gradient(position,color1,color2,...)
         position can be to left /to right/to bottom / to top/xdeg
       we can even assign the gradient or image to text 
       color:transparent;
       background-image: Linear-gradient(color1,color2);
       background-clip:text;

 Radial gradient : it is used to assign gradients circular way 
        background-image:radial-gradient(color1,color2)    

Box Model : Browsers treat Every elements as a box. A box contains 
     i.border
     ii.border-radius
     iii.paddding
     iv.margin

   i. border : border is the surrounding line for an element
      border: size shape color;
      we can even assign border-left,border-right,border-top,border-bottom  
   ii. border-radius : it is the corner radius surround the border corners.
      border-radius:size;
      50% of border-radius make actual circle for square shape 
      we can also assign each corner radius separately 
   iii. paddding : it is the space between border and actual content of element (inside the element)
      paddding:size;
     we can also assign paddding as paddding-left, paddding-right,paddding-top, paddding-bottom
     Normally, paddding makes each box increase its height or width because by default all are content boxes. so we need to use 
     box-sizing:border-box;

   iv. margin : it is the space outside the border, used for gap between the elements
      margin:size;
     we can also assign margin as margin-left,margin-right,margin-top,margin-bottom

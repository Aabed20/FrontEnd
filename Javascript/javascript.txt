To accept input, we use one method called prompt. But prompt accepts only strings.
let a = +prompt("enter a value");

Datatypes in javascript :
   javascript is a dynamic programming language.
   It means in javascript, there is no fixed Datatype to a variable. The Datatype of a variable is decided by value it is holding.

  There are two categories of datatypes:
     i. primitive datatypes
     ii. non primitive datatypes

   i.primitive datatypes : These datatypes holds the value and compares only value. These datatypes are immutable .    
    There are 5 basic primitive datatypes such accepts
     number, string, boolean,undefined, null

   ii. non primitive datatypes :
    These datatypes holds the value and compares the address/reference . These datatypes are mutable.
      The basic non primitive datatypes are  
      functions, arrays, objects


  can we chnage one datatype to another datatype?
    yes, The process of changing one datatype to another datatype is called typecasting. There are two types of typecasting 
     i.implicit typecasting
     ii. explicit typecasting

   i. implicit typecasting : it is the default or automatic conversion of datatypes based on operation.
    eg : 10 + "5" ===> "10"+"5" ===>"105"    
     5 * "4" ==> 20
     

   ii. explicit typecasting : it is the forced way of converting one datatype to another.
     eg : 5 + +'4' ===> 5 + 4 ==> 9 
          5 + Number('4') ==> 5 + 4 ==> 9

  number : Any numerical value is a number
    Every number can have some default methods such as toString, toPrecision etc..,
    numbers also have math methods such as sqrt, pow, ceil, floor etc..,
